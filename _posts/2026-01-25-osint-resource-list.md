This is a curated collection of high-efficiency OSINT resources, categorized by research requirements. No fluff, just the tools.

## Overview: The Intelligence Cycle

Modern reconnaissance is the art of connecting fragmented data. This guide organizes the essential toolkit into four strategic pillars of digital investigation:

* **Identity Mapping:** Establishing connections between aliases and social personas.
* **Visual Intelligence:** Extracting location and context from imagery and geospatial data.
* **Network Footprinting:** Mapping technical infrastructure and digital assets.
* **Breach Analysis:** Investigating historical data leaks for credential patterns.

## 1. Identity & Social Mapping (SOCMINT)

Used for tracking usernames, real names, and social footprints.

* **[IDCrawl](https://www.idcrawl.com/):** Web-based aggregator for usernames and public records.
* **[Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock):** Powerful CLI tool to hunt usernames across 400+ platforms.
* **[Maigret](https://github.com/soxoj/maigret):** Advanced username crawler that scrapes profile data for correlation.
* **[Epieos](https://epieos.com/):** Reverse email lookup to find linked social accounts without notification.

## 2. Imagery & Geospatial Intelligence (IMINT / GEOINT)

* **[Google Lens](https://lens.google.com/):** Fast identification of objects, landmarks, and text.
* **[Yandex Images](https://yandex.com/images/):** Superior facial recognition and profile matching results compared to other search engines.
* **[PimEyes](https://pimeyes.com/):** AI-powered face search engine for tracking visual digital footprints across the web.
* **[ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/):** Essential command-line tool for extracting GPS coordinates and metadata from image files.
* **[Wikimapia](http://wikimapia.org/):** An open-content collaborative map that provides detailed site analysis for GEOINT.

## 3. Technical Reconnaissance & Network Footprinting

* **[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/):** Search engine for internet-connected devices and vulnerabilities.
* **[Censys](https://censys.io/):** Infrastructure analysis tool for discovering host configurations and certificates.
* **[Whois.is](https://whois.is/):** Essential for domain ownership and registration history lookup.
* **[ViewDNS.info](https://viewdns.info/):** All-in-one toolkit for IP history and reverse WHOIS lookups.

## 4. Breach Intelligence

* **[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/):** The industry standard for checking email and phone data breaches.
* **[IntelX](https://intelx.io/):** A powerful search engine for data leaks, pastebins, and dark web content.
