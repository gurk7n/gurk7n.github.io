This is a curated collection of high-efficiency OSINT resources, categorized by research requirements. No fluff, just the tools.

## 1. Identity & Social Mapping (SOCMINT)

Used for tracking usernames, real names, and social footprints.

* **Syntax Break:** `'` (Check for database errors or anomalies)
* **Boolean Logic:** `OR 1=1` vs `OR 1=2` (Check for systematic differences in the application’s responses)
* **Time Delays:** `pg_sleep(10)` or `sleep(10)` (Check for differences in the time taken to respond)
* **OAST Payloads:** Designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction (e.g., `DNS` lookup)
